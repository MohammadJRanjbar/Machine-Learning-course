## Course Description

This course focuses on various aspects of Machine Learning, covering fundamental concepts and advanced techniques. 

## Table of Contents

Please find below a brief overview of the contents of this repository:
1. `HW1/`: This directory contains code for Assignment 1, which focused on Bayes. The assignment includes code for implementing Naive Bayes without using any libraries.
2. `HW2/`: This directory contains code for Assignment 2, which focused on Regression. The assignment includes code for implementing Naive Bayes without using any libraries.
3. `HW3/`: This directory contains code for Assignment 3, which focuses on KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Neural Network, and Decision Tree algorithms. The assignment includes code for implementing a simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for CIFAR-10 dataset and perceptron for the Iris dataset.
4. `HW4/`: This directory contains code for Assignment 4, which focuses on SVM (Support Vector Machine). The assignment includes code for implementing SVM with different hyperparameters and comparing their results. Additionally, it contains code for implementing SVR (Support Vector Regression) for a simple regression task.
5. `HW5/`: This directory contains code for Assignment 5, which focuses on feature selection methods, including LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), and Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE). The assignment includes code for implementing SFS and RFE on the Wine dataset. Additionally, PCA has been implemented for the Faces dataset. In Q7, LDA has been implemented for the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
6. `Final Project/`: Here, you can find code related to the projects completed as part of the course requirements.  This particular project focuses on the classification of Dastgah in Persian music. Dastgah refers to the modal system in Persian music, which organizes melodic types (gūšas) and arranges them around a dominant mode (māya). Each dastgāh derives its name from this dominant mode, which is played during the introductory parts. Our objective in this project is to classify music based on their respective dastgahs. To accomplish this, we follow these key steps:
   - Data Collection: We have collected a comprehensive dataset, accessible through this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmJ2MomwjbD2N-9TZks4IhPzGdarQnYb9HgU-G0T3Cc/edit#gid=0).
   *   **Data Preprocessing, analysis, and visualization**: To build a robust model, 
   need to clear our dataset by deleting incorrect files. Also, we need to find features that have the most correlation with our labels and help us in the       classification and clustering tasks.
   *   **Feature extraction**: Based on the information acquired in the first part we need to extract features and prepare our dataset for the next part.
   *   **Classification**: In this part, Based on the features extracted from the model and their correlation with our classes, We need to design the best model that does the task of classifying. In this project, We try models such as Multilayer Perceptron, SVM, etc.
   *   **Clustering**: Clustering music dastgah is a task of grouping music based on the similarities in their audio characteristics.
